        <h1>Constitution of the Interstate Government Between the Contiguous United States 
            of America</h1>

        <h2>Article 1: The Territorial Claims of Interstate Governance</h2>
        <h3>Section 1</h3>
        <p>The Interstate Constitution lays claim to all borders between states of the 
            contiguous United States of America. The territorial extent of the Interstate 
            Government is legally immutable and may only grow with the incorporation and
            establishment of adjacent states by the United States of America. The Interstate
            Constitution lays no claim to any territory located within state borders.
        </p>
        <h3> Section 2</h3>
        <p>Every unbroken border between two states forms a separate division of Interstate 
            governance.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 3</h3>
        <p>An individual belongs to the interstate border to which they most closely reside. 
            All individuals who belong to an interstate border may govern as prescribed by 
            the Interstate Constitution. An indvidual who lives equidistant to the closest 
            interstate borders do not belong to an Interstate division, but they may participate
            in actions sanctioned by an Interstate division department committee.
